<h1>Exercise 1</h1>
<p>
Write a python program that given some messages stolen from a messaging app can extract
if the message contains some reference to a time.
It should take in a message from <code>input()</code> and produce a python
datetime object that it then prints out.
There is no strict scope here on purpose, try to see if your program can handle anything
that you could see a person saying to refer to a time.
Below are only some examples. Obviously if you can't deduce all the info from the
message you have to make suitable assumptions. i.e If you just say Friday assume
it means the coming friday.
<blockquote> Assume the below code was run Feb 7th 2019 at 8:41</blockquote>

<h1>Exercise 2</h1>
<p>Write a python class with at least 1 function called <code> talk </code> which
  given a slack message will return a response.
  If your class has no response return <code>None</code>You can code up this class to do whatever
  but it should be able to print the current weather.
  Just make sure that if your bot has a trigger phrase so <code>what's the weather</code>
  does nothing but <code>hey weatherbot, what's the weather</code> returns a response.
</p>
<blockquote>Below is a example </blockquote>
<pre><code>> now
> weather bot, what's the weather tomorrow
it will be 23 degrees tomorrow in sydney
> weather bot, what's the weather tomorrow in chiagao
it will be -10 degrees tomorrow in chiago
