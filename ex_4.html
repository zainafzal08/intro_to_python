<h1>Exercise 1</h1>
<p>
Write a python program that given some messages stolen from a messaging app can extract
if the message contains some reference to a time. It should take in a message from `input()` and produce a python
datetime object that it then prints out.
There is no strict scope on purpose, try to see if your program can handle anything that you could see a person saying to
refer to a time. below are only some examples. Obviously if you can't deduce all the info from the message you have to make suitable assumptions.
if you just say Friday assume it means the comming friday for example.
<blockquote> Assume the below code was run Feb 7th 2019 at 8:41</blockquote>

<h1>Exercise 2</h1>
<p>
  Although we may run out of time it would be cool to have you guys build a slack bot still.
  So write a python class with at least 1 function called <code> talk </code> which
  given a slack message will return a response. If your class has no response return <code>None</code>You can code up this class to do whatever, return the current weather if someone asks for it, process a math equation etc.
  Just make sure that if your bot has a trigger phrase so <code>what's the weather</code> does nothing but <code>hey weatherbot, what's the weather</code> returns a response.
</p>
<blockquote>Below is a example if you wanted to build a weather bot </blockquote>
<pre><code>> now
> weather bot, what's the weather tomorrow
it will be 23 degrees tomorrow in sydney
> weather bot, what's the weather tomorrow in chiagao
it will be -10 degrees tomorrow in chiago
...
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      You can add/remove as many features as you like but start small.
      Remember if the bot shouldn't respond to a message it should return none, the bot will recieve every message in the channel it is in so it needs to be able to ignore some messages.
