        <h1><a></a>Excersize 1</h1>
        <p>Write a function that takes in 1 number x and prints out a x by x times table nicely formatted, for example if i called f(x) i'd get </p>
       <pre><code>  | 1   2   3   4   5

      <h1><a></a>Excersize 2</h1>
      <p>Write a function that takes in a list of _tuples_ where each tuple contains a fruit, it's cost and the selling price of the fruit </p>
     <p> Calculate the optimal set of fruits to buy which will maximise your profits BUT you can't buy more then n fruits because that's all the space you have in your store, i.e write a function f(fruits, max) which returns the set of fruits to buy</p>
      <pre><code>fruits = []
fruits.append(("apple",12,5))   # an apple worth 12 bucks with a selling price of 5 bucks
fruits.append(("bannana",3,100)
l = f(fruits,1) # l is ["bannana"] which is the most profitable
    </code></pre>
    <h1><a></a>Excersize 3</h1>
    <p>Write a function that takes in a movie title such as "need for speed" and generates every possible play on the title that involves changing 1 character, such as "seed for speed" or "need far speed", but every word must still be a word in the english dictionary so xeed for speed isn't a valid result. 
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <pre><code>
      l = f("need for speed")
      print(l) # ["seed for speed",...]
