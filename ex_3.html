    </section>

    <section class="main-content">
        <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
        <p>Write a class called MyString which has a function called "devowel" which returns the
          input string with no vowel</p>
        <pre><code>s = MyString("hello")
s.devowel() # returns "hll"
          </code></pre>
          <h1>Exercise 2</h1>
          <p>Write a class called Player which starts with 100 health has 2 functions,
            hit and heal which hit and heal the player for some specified value.
            Once the players health to 0 or less, print out "he ded"</p>
          <pre><code>p = Player()
p.hit(99)
p.heal(20)
p.hit(20)
p.hit(1) # prints out "he ded"
            </code></pre>
            <h1>Exercise 3</h1>
            <p>Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and which
              has two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle</p>
            <pre><code> c = Circle(5)
c.perimeter() # prints out 2*pi*5
c.area() # prints out pi*5^2
              </code></pre>
              <h1>Exercise 4</h1>
              <p>Write 2 Python classs named Rectangle and Square, Rectangle should take in
                height and width and have a function to computer permeter and area.
                Square should inherit these functions from Rectangle and be constructed with
                just 1 paramater, x</p>
              <pre><code> r = Rectangle(1,2)
r.area()      # 2
r.perimeter() # 6
s = Square(2)
s.perimeter() # 8
s.area()      # 4
                </code></pre>
