        <p>First of all what is python? Python is a interpreted programming language, it lets us talk to computers and ask them to do things for us.<br>
        We write python in plain text and pass it into the python interperter, it <em>interperts</em> the code we give it into instructions the computer understands and will run those.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sidenote: Python gets compiled into python bytecode which similar to java runs on a VM, This Vm gives the code a lot of extra features such as dynamic typing and error handling and portability of code but obviously comes with major speed hits. Where a language like C compiles directly to machine code that runs on your cpu, python is run on a layer of code that is constantly checking things and managing the enviornment. This is a tradeoff, you get simpler code that is easier to reason about but the speed tanks. <strong>Thatâ€™s ok for most reasons, computers are quite fast and you are happy to wait a couple of seconds for results where doing them by hand would take months.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To talk to the python interperter you have to write code in the python syntax, which is designed to be somewhat easy to pick up. To play with python you can launch up a interpert session by opening a terminal in your intellij window and typing in <code>python</code></p>
